# AssetTracking
Mini project with different levels during System developer .NET studies @ Lexicon. Written in C#.

## Project description
A console app that keeps track of assets (in my example, laptops and mobile phones).

User input:
1. Brand
2. Model
3. Purchase date (End of Life date is 3 years from purchase date for all products)
4. Price
5. Type (laptop/mobile phone)

- Add products to list.
- Quit and/or display list by typing "exit".
- Display sorted list. Sorted by type first, then purchase date.
- Display assets red if they are less than 3 months away from End Of Life date or overdue.
- Display assets yellow if they are less than 6 months away from End Of Life date.
- Error handling.

## Room for improvement
Create more methods from some code to be able to reuse in different scenarios.
